    RE_Norse_Events.1.t: "Where are the Ice Giants?"
    RE_Norse_Events.1.d: "Pray for your soul to be saved, they say, as you are a sinner since the day you are born. Otherwise, the fires of hell shall consume your flesh and devils shall dance upon you, picking you with their sharpen forks. The very same thing happens when you do not obey to priests' demands. Of course.\n\nMeanwhile, Odin just simply promised to kill all ice giants.\nThe question is quite simple: have you seen any ice giant recently?"
    RE_Norse_Events.1.a: "No ice giants anywhere to be seen! Hail Odin!"
    RE_Norse_Events.1.b: "I want priests to have my gold, my daughters, my soul and whatever else they want..."
    
    RE_Norse_Events.2.t: "Flock is Gathering"
    RE_Norse_Events.2.d: "The news is that the believers of Norse faith's old customs are rising in numbers and their influence is spreading like a wildfire.\n\nIf we want to stop them, we must act swiftly as such a situation, left unsettled might quickly get out of control and become gravely dangerous."
    RE_Norse_Events.2.a: "We must stop them!"
    RE_Norse_Events.2.a: "Let them grow..."
    
    RE_Norse_Events.4.t: "Hail to Odin!"
    RE_Norse_Events.4.d: "The preachers of the Norse faith encouraged by the recent events have woken up from their slumber. Armed in whatever they could find, they have emerged from hidden places and flocked under the raven banner of Odin, hailing in his name.\n\nThe word of rebellion quickly spreads through the country, encouraging even more people to join in.Rebels have only one demand, as it seems - to recognize their never really forgotten customs as a true and only one religion of state!"
    RE_Norse_Events.4.a: "We are doomed to fall!"

    RE_Norse_Events.5.t: "Spread Faith?"
    RE_Norse_Events.5.d: "Since we have re-embraced the Norse faith there have been constant pressure on us to spread our beliefs aboard. Many of true believers and sorcerers speak that we can no longer tolerate unbelievers passively.\n\nThey say, Christians were not so kind to us as they should have been according to their holy book and thus there is no guarantee they would not attack us again, trying to wipe out our beliefs.\n\nWe must learn from our mistakes and act first! Yet, there will always be consequences."
    RE_Norse_Events.5.a: "Let the words spread!"

    RE_Norse_Events.6.t: "Spreading Norse Faith"
    RE_Norse_Events.6.d: "The word has reached you that there are some weird people from nearby [From.GetName] travelling countryside, spreading truly weird words about Odin and Norse faith.\n\nDue to fear or simply belief, some of peasants and other \"lower people\" are willing to hear the call."
    RE_Norse_Events.6.a: "What?! We have to punish these [From.GetAdjective] trespassers!"

    RE_Norse_Events.7.t: "Go Viking?"
    RE_Norse_Events.7.d: "In the years passed our ancestors were constantly invading neighbour lands for loot in gold and slaves. Many of our people view this act as something more than just a custom but rather as a natural way of how the world works - if you lack something then you go and take it from someone who has it in plenty (or just has it at all).\n\nNo wonder why they are so willing to take their sword, axes and go for plunder. Of course this will give our neighbours a valid cause to take a revenge on us."

    RE_Norse_Events.8.d: "These murderous beasts from [From.GetName] just crossed the border out of nowhere and started to plunder! They have taken whatever they wanted, whoever they could enslave and then raped, killed or burned anything else.\n\nNow only white embers glows amidst the ruins and the cries of our fallen fill the sky."

    RE_Norse_Events.9.t: "The Seer"
    RE_Norse_Events.9.d: "In the eve of your march to the war, the Seer approaches and offers casting rune sticks to foretell your fate. You may agree and take a look in the upcoming future but be aware as Seers almost always speak in riddles.\n\nShould gods favour you, great things might be revealed and come to your aid but if you are not gods' favourite then you invite your doom!"
