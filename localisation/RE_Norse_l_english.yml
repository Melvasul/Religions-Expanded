    RE_Norse_Events.27.t: "Shieldwall Formation"
    RE_Norse_Events.27.d: "Our ancestors adapted scraps of Roman warfare techniques of how to effectively stand in a formation on battlefield and over decades popularized a stance known as Shieldwall.\n\nThe stance is quite effective in a close combat, where the first ranks mostly hold the line, overlapping their shields with the shields of their neighbours and use short swords to jab into enemy positions; the following ranks often hold their shields high, overlapping them to make a defence against arrows and thrown tools while at the same time using long-shafted weapons to destroy or pull enemies' shields.\n\nIt is said by custom among our people that only in horrors of Shieldwall a man can become a true warrior. No matter how hard you train and learn, you are not recognized as a warrior until you go at the front of Shieldwall for the very first time in your life. Only then, and of course also only when you survive, you have the right to be known as a true fighter.\n\nShieldwall was utilised for generations and effectively adapted by many victorious armies. Yet, as the current battlefield quickly shapes and changes maybe is it the highest time to look forward into developing more modern methods and means of warfare?"

    RE_Norse_Events.28.d: "With the development of more convenient types of firearms the war has forever shifted its mean. Year by year more troops are equipped with weapons that could bring death from far away and no longer mere a wooden shield, no matter how sturdy it would be can protect its wielder from a deadly bullet.\n\nIn the face of such a change our previously perfectly viable strategy of utilising Shieldwall is being quickly depreciated with more warriors dead or gravely wounded.\n\nThe rules of axe and shield are finished, the times of bullets are upon us!"

    string_RE_Norse_doctrine_lightning_strike: "\n\nBy utilising our natural Norse ferocity and love for skirmishes and sorties, our most notable strategists invented the new doctrine of warfare by almost completely excluding stationary trade-offs of fire volleys\n\nThe doctrine is called "Lightning Strike" and draws upon quick and deadly manoeuvres with small bands of so-called fire teams which are responsible for making quick and deadly deep breakthroughs of enemy lines in order to widely encircle and divide their forces to spread terror and disorganisation in their lines. By not giving them time to recover, we are able to quickly overrun and annihilate their will to fight."

Moreover, the artillery is the best way to break through any means of fortifications, dramatically reducing time needed to conquer enemy positions."

We believe a magic hides in them, something that makes us wise and let us discover what is beyond the veil of this world.\n\nSometimes they give knowledge, sometimes just a joy and not so rarely only a headache and a nausea but it will not stop anyone among us from using them."
