Otherwise, the fires of hell shall consume your flesh and devils shall dance upon you, picking you with their sharpen forks. The very same thing happens when you do not obey to priests' demands. Of course.\n\nMeanwhile, Odin just simply promised to kill all ice giants.\nThe question is quite simple: have you seen any ice giant recently?"
